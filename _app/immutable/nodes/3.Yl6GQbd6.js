            The things I enjoy doing the most are reading, trying new foods or restaurants, drinking tea, and playing games!\r
            If I had to give my top 5 games, they would be: League of Legends, World of Warcraft, anything Pokemon, Magic the Gathering, and the Pathfinder RPG.\r
            When I play Pathfinder, I usually am the Game Master because I love worldbuilding and lore.\r
            I sometimes even read lore for games I don't play because I'm a sucker for the interesting tidbits that someone put effort into crafting.\r
